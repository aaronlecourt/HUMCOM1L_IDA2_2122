                <b>New Eden</b> is the name for the star cluster which is inhabited by the human race. The term is colloquial in nature, 
                as the name is alternately applied to every star system in the galactic neighborhood, only those that have been explored 
                and cataloged by humans, or solely those which are currently connected by working stargate networks. 
                In common usage, the last definition is most frequently meant, and is the definition used in this article.
            </p>
            <h1>Structure</h1>
            <img class="eden-img"src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/36/72/303672de46f24b3d4a3f8e6785e5bb5a.jpg" alt="star_map">
            <p>
                New Eden is a loosely-bound cluster of stars approximately 106 light years long, 90 light years wide, 
                and 25 light years thick. The cluster contains 5,433 star systems with stargate connections, though significantly more stars and 
                stellar remnants with no gate connections exist within. Because stargates are almost exclusively deployed in star systems with orbital 
                bodies, every star system within New Eden has at least one planet. It similarly contains many black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs, 
                but these have also been mostly left unconnected to the stargate system. The cluster is relatively densely packed, 
                with the average system having at least one neighbor less than a light year away from it. It is composed of stars of all stellar classifications and ages.
            </p>
            <p>
                When looking at charted star maps, explorers often notice a filamentary structure to the cluster, especially at its edges. 
                This leads some to believe that there are massive voids of stars within the cluster, but this is only partly true. 
                Many of these gaps are filled with stars which have simply not been connected to the rest of the cluster through stargates. 
                Such gaps are occasionally "filled in", most recently when the Caldari State opened several connecting gates to Black Rise. Some voids are actually devoid of stars, 
                such as Divinity's Edge, or are in the midst of heavy stellar formation, such as with the Vapor Sea.

            <h1>History</h1>
            <h3>Colonization and Collapse</h3>
            <p>
                Archeological evidence implies human beings first visited New Eden roughly 15,000 years ago. The exact mechanism by which humans ventured into
                 the cluster is unknown, though evidence points to the EVE Gate, located in the system from which the cluster takes its name, as the entryway. 
                 It appears these early settlers, over a period of roughly one-hundred years, colonized planets throughout the cluster, until a sudden disaster apparently 
                 struck them. The exact nature of this disaster is unknown, but it was catastrophic enough that within a few generations, the technology of the settlements 
                 had regressed significantly.
            </p>

            <h3>Dark Ages</h3>
            <p>
                Over the intervening centuries, the majority of the settlements died out. A few managed to survive and slowly began to regain their lost technology. 
                The first of these are the people who would come to be known as the Jove. The Jove are notoriously secretive and have shared little of their history. 
                They once inhabited the region known as Curse during their First Empire. Following the contraction of a malady known as the Jovian Disease, they abandoned 
                the area in an attempt to escape the affliction. Roughly 3000 years ago, Miko Bour united them in a Second Empire.
                <br><br>
                At some other point, at least three other ancient civilizations rose to power. Today, they are known mainly by the artifacts and ruins they left behind, 
                with little knowledge of what caused them to rise and eventually vanish from the cluster's landscape. They are known as the Sleepers, Talocan, and Yan Jung, 
                though the recent discovery of wormhole space has provided tantalizing clues about the fates of the Sleepers and Talocan. A fourth ancient civilization, 
                the Takmahl, arose later as an offshoot of Amarr exiles.

            <h1>CONCORD and Cluster-Wide Peace</h1>
            <p>
                In 23230 AD, the five nations came together and founded CONCORD as an interstellar peace-keeping organization. CONCORD brokered peace treaties between 
                the Gallente and Caldari, putting an end to their nearly-century long war, and the Amarr and Minmatar, freeing the Republic from the immediate fear of 
                invasion and reenslavement.

                Soon after, in 23236 AD (YC0), CONCORD hosted the Yoiul Conference, which established EVE Standard Time. An unsteady peace embraced the cluster, only being 
                briefly broken by the rise and destruction of Sansha's Nation. This peace continued for over a century.
