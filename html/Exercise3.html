        <li>    4 green onions, cut into 2 inch long</li>  
    </ul>

    <small><b><i>FOR SEASONINGS</i></b></small>
    <ul  style ="list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>    2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>    2 tablespoons gochu-garu (Korean hot pepper flakes)</li>
        <li>    ¼ cup rice syrup</li>
        <li>    ¼ cup gochujang (Korean fermented hot pepper paste)</li> 
        <li>    1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>    8 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>    1 teaspoon peeled ginger, minced</li>
        <li>    1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>

    <h4 style="color: #b32323;">Directions</h4>
    <small><b><i>PREPARE THE PORK RIBS</i></b></small>
    <ol>
        <li>    Soak the ribs in cold water for 1 to 2 hours, changing water a couple of times. Drain.</li>
        <li>    Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the ribs. <br>Cover and cook for 5 minutes until some brownish foam and smelly fat floats to the surface.</li>
        <li>    Rinse the ribs in cold running water and drain. Put them into a large <br> bowl and wash the large pot that the ribs were in.</li>
        <li>    Add all the ingredients for seasonings into the bowl with the ribs and <br>mix it all together by hand. You can wear a rubber glove for this if you want.</li> 
        <li>    Place the onion on the bottom of the pot and add the seasoned ribs over top. <br>
                Then lay the kimchi on top of the ribs. Cut the stem of the kimchi with a <br>
                kitchen knife or scissors so that the kimchi will be cooked nicely.</li>
        <li>    8 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
    </ol>

    <small style="color: #b32323;"><b><i>COOK</i></b></small>

        <li>    Reduced the heat to medium and cook for another 10 minutes with the lid on. </li>
