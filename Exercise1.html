    Dune is based on a <b>complex</b> imagined society set roughly 20,000 years in the future. The setting is the year 10,191, 
    and human beings have spread out and colonized planets throughout the universe. On the planet <u>Caladan</u>, 
    <u>Duke Leto</u> of the House of Atreides is preparing to leave for his new position as the governor of <u>Arrakis</u>, 
    a desert planet with <b>valuable</b> resources of melange, a spice drug that is extremely popular with <b>wealthy</b> people. 
    <u>Leto</u> and his family, including his concubine, <u>Jessica</u>, and his son, <u>Paul</u>, suspect a trap by their rivals, the Harkonnens, 
    led by <u>Baron Harkonnen</u>. Leto decides to settle on Arrakis because of its <b>rich</b> supplies of melange, despite warnings from his men, 
    including his adviser, <u>Thufir Hawat</u>, and his master-of-arms, <u>Gurney Halleck</u>.
<br/><br/>
    The <u>Atreides</u> arrive on Arrakis and the duke <b>quickly</b> moves to secure the planet from a Harkonnen attack. 
    His main plan is to enlist the <u>Fremen</u>, the <b>tough</b> natives of the Arrakeen desert, as soldiers and advisers. Meanwhile, 
    Paul’s and Jessica’s <b>special</b> abilities intrigue the Fremen. <u>Jessica</u> is a member of the Bene Gesserit, a school of <b>quasi-mystical</b> 
    witches with <b>strange</b> powers. The Fremen believe that Jessica and her son are saviors who have come to lead them toward creating 
    a <b>lush</b> paradise on the <b>dry</b> Arrakis.
<br/><br/>
    Two years pass. The baron, living on the Harkonnen home world, schemes to usurp the emperor, while grooming one of his own nephews, 
    <u>Feyd-Rautha</u>, to take over the job. Meanwhile, on Arrakis, Paul has become very <b>powerful</b> and <b>influential</b> among the Fremen. 
    He is both their secular and religious leader, like Kynes before him, but his powers are far greater than those of Kynes. 
    He has a child with a Fremen woman, <u>Chani</u>, the daughter of Kynes, and his mother has given birth to <u>Alia</u>, Duke Leto’s daughter. 
    Paul teaches the Fremen to fight using a <b>special</b> style called the “weirding way” and using the <b>advanced</b> fighting techniques of the Bene Gesserit. 
    One day, the Fremen discover that the baron has abandoned his aid to Rabban, the nephew he assigned to rule over Arrakis. 
    Paul and the Fremen make plans to raid the Arrakeen capital now that Rabban is cut off from the baron’s help.
<br/><br/>
    Upon discovering the power of the Fremen, the emperor himself comes to Arrakis, along with his Sardaukar and the Harkonnens. 
    The Fremen attack the emperor, quickly dismantling his spaceships while destroying the Sardaukar. In the battle, 
    Alia kills Baron Harkonnen, and Paul’s <b>young</b> son dies in a raid. Paul demands that the emperor step down; Paul asks to marry the emperor’s daughter, 
    <u>Irulan</u>, so that he may become the <b>new</b> emperor. Feyd-Rautha challenges Paul, citing the right of vengeance, and Paul kills him in a duel. 
    <b>Powerless</b> now, the emperor agrees to Paul’s demands, and Paul becomes the <b>new</b> emperor.
